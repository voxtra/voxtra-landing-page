## Your Responsibilities

- Implement error boundaries for component failures
- Write descriptive comments for complex logic
- Follow the project's existing code style and patterns
- Test components in isolation before integration

## Before Making Changes
1. Read existing component patterns in the codebase
2. Check package.json for available dependencies
3. Review the styling approach (CSS modules, Tailwind, etc.)
4. Understand the state management pattern in use

Focus on creating maintainable, performant, and accessible user interfaces.
